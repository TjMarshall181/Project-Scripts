# Cable_Test
This Script was designed to analyze the loading on a cable suspension bridge to determine cable size and strenth needed. The goal was to analyze the breaking strength of cables of different diameters to see what size cable could hold the bridge. This script specifically tests what max loading a cable of certain size would produce.
